### A mask that adds functionality to a Cell.
### A mask is like a mixin, except that it doesn't
### actually get mixed in and should not assume
### any additional state other than that of a default
### Cell.  The methods in a mask are meant to be
### called using ``as``.
###
### There is no code here, this object is just
### for organizing the cell masks. They should also all begin
### with ``CM``.
